# üîÑ API vs Web API: What's the Difference?

## üß© Application Programming Interface (API)
- Interface that allows **two software components** to talk to each other.
- Can be **local or remote**, not limited to the web.
- Examples:
  - Python libraries (e.g., `os`, `math`)
  - Operating system APIs
  - Internal research data pipelines

---

## üåê Web API (Web-based API)
- **A type of API** that uses **HTTP/S** to communicate over the **internet**.
- Often follows **REST** or **GraphQL** conventions.
- Enables **remote access to data and services**.

## üìä Analogy

| Feature       | API                        | Web API                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Scope         | Any software interaction   | Interaction via the web                      |
| Protocol      | Various (not just HTTP)    | HTTP/HTTPS                                   |
| Location      | Local or remote            | Remote (web servers)                         |
| Examples      | Python's `os` module       | GitHub API, 4TU.ResearchData API             |
| Research Use  | Internal tools/scripts     | Publishing data, querying datasets remotely  |

## üéì Research Relevance

- APIs help **structure and automate** research workflows.
- Web APIs enable **integration, publication, and reuse** of research data.
