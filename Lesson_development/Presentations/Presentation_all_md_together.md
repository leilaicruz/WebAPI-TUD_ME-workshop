# üîß What is an API?

## üìò Definition
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of **rules and tools** that allow software applications to communicate with each other.

- Think of it as a **contract** between two software components.
- It defines **how to request services** and **what response to expect**.

---

## üß† How APIs Work

APIs expose certain **functions or data** to external users (or internal systems), allowing them to:
- Retrieve information
- Send or modify data
- Trigger actions or computations

APIs can be:
- **Local** (between software on the same machine)
- **Remote** (between software across the internet ‚Äî aka Web APIs)

## üß™ Examples of APIs in Research

| Use Case                              | Description                                                              | API Type      |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Dataset access from repositories      | Query and download datasets from 4TU.ResearchData, Zenodo, Dataverse     | Web API (REST)|
| Publication automation                | Submit and update research outputs programmatically                      | Web API (REST)|
| Metadata enrichment                   | Add ORCID info, grant metadata from Crossref or Fundref                 | Web API (REST)|
| Data analysis environments            | Use APIs in R/Python to call scientific packages (e.g., NumPy, SciPy)   | Local API     |
| Instrument control in laboratories    | Programmatically access sensors and machines (via vendor SDKs/APIs)     | Local API     |
| High-performance computing (HPC) jobs | Submit/monitor jobs using APIs like SLURM or workload managers           | Local/Web API |
| Linked data queries                   | Use SPARQL APIs to extract structured data from semantic repositories    | Web API (SPARQL)|

---

## üéì Why Are APIs Important in Research?

- **Automation**: Eliminate repetitive tasks (e.g., uploading new data versions)
- **Reproducibility**: Workflows become scriptable and shareable
- **Scalability**: Analyze or query large datasets remotely without downloading everything
- **Interoperability**: Connect systems like ELNs, data repositories, and lab instruments

---

## üìé Bonus Tip

Using APIs in your research lets you **build FAIR-aligned workflows**, especially when integrated with metadata standards and versioning tools.







# üîÑ API vs Web API: What's the difference?

## üß© Application Programming Interface (API)
- Interface that allows **two software components** to talk to each other.
- Can be **local or remote**, not limited to the web.
- Examples:
  - Python libraries (e.g., `os`, `math`)
  - Operating system APIs
  - Internal research data pipelines

---

## üåê Web API (Web-based API)
- **A type of API** that uses **HTTP/S** to communicate over the **internet**.
- Often follows **REST** or **GraphQL** conventions.
- Enables **remote access to data and services**.

---

## üìä Analogy

| Feature       | API                        | Web API                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Scope         | Any software interaction   | Interaction via the web                      |
| Protocol      | Various (not just HTTP)    | HTTP/HTTPS                                   |
| Location      | Local or remote            | Remote (web servers)                         |
| Examples      | Python's `os` module       | GitHub API, 4TU.ResearchData API             |
| Research Use  | Internal tools/scripts     | Publishing data, querying datasets remotely  |

---

## üéì Research Relevance

- APIs help **structure and automate** research workflows.
- Web APIs enable **integration, publication, and reuse** of research data.



# üåê Types of Web APIs and Why REST is Most Used

|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| REST     | HTTP/HTTPS       | JSON, XML     | Public APIs, data sharing        | 4TU.ResearchData, GitHub, Twitter           |
| SOAP     | SOAP over HTTP   | XML           | Enterprise systems, high security| Banking, healthcare systems                 |

## ‚úÖ Why is REST the Most Used Web API?

| Reason             | Explanation                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplicity**      | Easy to use with standard tools like `curl` or `requests` in Python        |
| **Uses HTTP**       | Works with the same protocol as the web                                    |
| **Stateless**       | Each request is independent; better for scalability                        |
| **Human-readable**  | Typically uses JSON ‚Äî easy to debug and understand                         |
| **Language-agnostic**| Works with all major programming languages                                |
| **Community support**| Huge ecosystem and documentation                                          |

## üéì Why REST is Ideal for Research

- Works great with tools like Python, R, Jupyter, and shell scripts.
- Data repositories (e.g., **4TU.ResearchData**, **Zenodo**, **Figshare**) use REST APIs.
- Simplifies **data publication, access, and automation** in the research lifecycle.
- Reduces manual work and encourages reproducibility.

---

## üìö Examples in Practice

- Use `GET` to retrieve datasets programmatically.
- Use `POST` to publish new datasets from your script.
- Use `PUT` or `PATCH` to update metadata.
